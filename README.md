we implement the standard chess game in JAVA, a popular object-oriented programming language. Our program has been developed and thoroughly tested on Windows. It allows two players to compete against each other. JAVA's object-oriented characteristics, which include abstraction and inheritance which greatly simplify development. At the end of the paper, we also discuss some areas that could be improved.
The Background of System
The chess game is a casual game that requires two players to play on an 
8-by-8 chessboard. The game's principles are simple, but there are 
limitless ways to move the pieces, so each step is vital to the player. The 
chess game is a highly adversarial game that requires players to 
consolidate step by step and develop their logical thinking ability. 
Computers, a machine that can perform numerical calculations, logical 
operations, memory storage, and program operations, are already playing 
an indispensable role in this digital age. It can replace human thinking and 
deal with problems that human beings cannot solve. Computer provides 
chess game a brand new carrier, which not only makes it more convenient 
for people to play recreational games, train their intelligence and improve 
their chess skills, but also enables people to see the omnipotent 
compatibility of the computer field and the development vitality of other 
industries brought by computers. Even more it is helpful to promote 
research in the field of artificial intelligence. The crucial role the computer 
plays in the chess game is storing a large number of game records and 
remnants, acting as assistants in the game, helping players check the 
game, studying opponents, preparing and analyzing the situation before 
the game. The methods of analyzing chess games and documenting rules 
presented by the computer may help solve many practical problems such 
as economic management, military command and so on in the future. 
Chess is often regarded as the game that is most commonly associated 
with intelligence and strategy. Science has in fact proven that chess 
players have more cognitive skill than non-chess players. Chess 
increases problem-solving skills. Legendary former World Champion 
Garry Kasparov once wrote: “Chess helps you to concentrate, improve 
your logic. It teaches you to play by the rules and take responsibility for 
your actions, how to problem solve in an uncertain environment.” As a 
result, if a player is able to defeat another player, we feel that Artificial 
Intelligence (hence AI) could simplify the wining opportunities by showing 
the next moves possibilities. Our game is entirely relied on encoded
human knowledge; it is likely that Artificial Intelligence (hence AI) will be 
also involved. That is why JAVA programming language and Artificial 
Intelligence (hence AI) are two approaches we chose.
